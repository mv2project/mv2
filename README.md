## Try it!
You can find a running prototype of the client on our [GitHub-page](mv2project.github.io/mv2/WebClientTestPage.html). The application needs an installed and enabled Silverlight-plugin to be executed.
See the following table for test accounts to use.
<table>
<tr><th>Address</th><th>Password</th></tr>
<tr><td>testuser1@shome1.selfhost.eu</td><td>testUser1</td></tr>
<tr><td>testuser2@shome1.selfhost.eu</td><td>testUser2</td></tr>
<tr><td>testuser3@shome1.selfhost.eu</td><td>testUser3</td></tr>
</table>
**Important:** This prototype is intended for testing purposes only. There is no gurantee.
